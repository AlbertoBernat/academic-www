## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4.5 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- [Commento](https://commento.io/), a fast, privacy-focused commenting platform is now supported in addition to [Disqus](https://disqus.com)
  
## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v4.4:

Add to the bottom of `config/_default/params.toml`:

```toml
# Comments.
[comments]
  # Comment provider:
  #   0: Disabled
  #   1: Disqus (https://disqus.com)
  #   2: Commento (https://commento.io)
  engine = 0

  # Which page types are commentable?
  commentable = {page = true, post = true, docs = true}

  # Configuration of Disqus.
  [comments.disqus]
    shortname = ""  # Paste the shortname from your Disqus dashboard.
    show_count = true  # Show comment count in page header? (true/false)
```

*Editable* in `config/_default/params.toml` can now be set to allow visitors to edit more page types - *Page* and *Post* have been added:

```toml
edit_page = {repo_url = "https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO>", editable = {docs = true, page = false, post = false}}
```

Improvements to page front matter for pages, posts, and docs page types:

To override the global setting to enable or disable commenting on a page: `commentable: true` 

To override the global setting to enable or disable editing of a page: `editable: true`
