## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4 release of Academic. This version is all about **people**! There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- **User profile system**
  - Displays a profile page for every author and enables visitors to discover content authored by them
- **Fully personalized contact links**
  - Create any number of contact links in the Contact widget - easily link to your Twitter, WhatsApp, Skype, Wechat, Weibo, etc.
- **People widget (coming soon)**
  - Enables organisations to easily introduce their staff and organisation structure
- **Re-usable About widget**
  - Great for showcasing team members

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v3.3:

### Configuration and About Widget

- **Hugo v0.53+ required**
- Upgrade your config to the easier to manage [**multi-file structure**](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite/config/_default)
  - note that some variables have been moved or renamed (such as their prefixes removed, especially for those in square brackets)
  - the explicit `telegram`, `skype`, `keybase`, and `discussion` options are deprecated but they are still supported with the new `contact_links` (see next item)
  - `contact_links` in [params.toml](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/exampleSite/config/_default/params.toml) enables you to add any number of custom contact links, such as Twitter, WhatsApp, Skype, Wechat, Weibo, etc.

### User Accounts

[Create a user account for yourself]({{< relref "/docs/get-started.md#introduce-yourself" >}}) based on the [*admin* template](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/tree/master/exampleSite/content/author).

Note that each folder name corresponds to a username. Username folders must be lowercase and use hyphens (-) instead of spaces. You can then enter a username in the `authors` field of a page in order to link to a user profile, e.g. `authors = ["Admin"]`.

### Publications

If using Selected Publications widget:

- Edit `home/publications_selected.md` to convert `widget = "publications_selected"` to `widget = "publications_featured"`
- Update the front matter of any featured publications to convert `selected = true` to `featured = true`

Publication types ("Journal Article" etc.) have finally been moved from the config to the language packs. Currently, they have been added to the English pack and can be translated as usual for the other language packs.

### Talks

If using Selected Talks widget:

- Edit `home/talks_selected.md` to convert `widget = "talks_selected"` to `widget = "talks_featured"`
- Update the front matter of any featured talks to convert `selected = true` to `featured = true`

For talks, if you do not wish to display a time for the talk, just add `all_day = true` to the talk's front matter.

### Custom CSS and JS

If you are using custom CSS/JS, move custom JS/CSS from `static/` to `assets/` folder (create the folder if it does not exist). Keep it under `js` or `css` subdirectory as before.

Then use the following options in the new `params.toml` to load your custom scripts:

```toml
# Load CSS and JS plugins
#   E.g. To load `/assets/css/custom.css`, set `plugins_css = ["custom"]`.
#   E.g. To load `/assets/js/custom.js`, set `plugins_js = ["custom"]`.
plugins_css = ["custom"]
plugins_js  = ["custom"]
```

## Dates

Improved display of dates in talks and publications (#891)

- In v3 of Academic, the publish date for every page was displayed at the top in the page metadata. This meant that dates could be displayed twice on talk and publication pages, which already had separate date fields
- For publications, we have formatted the date in the metadata according to publication date format parameter (in `params.toml`) and removed the second date that was shown
- For talks, we have removed the date that the page was published as this may be confused with the talk date

## Thank you
