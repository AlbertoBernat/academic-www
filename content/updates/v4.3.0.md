## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4.3 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- Converted CSS styling to SCSS for tighter integration with Bootstrap and Academic's theming system
  - This refactoring is unlikely to affect any custom CSS in *CSS Plugins*
- Fixes (see below) for authors and some tag/category links that were broken by breaking changes in Hugo v0.55

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v4.2:

- In `config/_default/config.toml`, remove `"CSS"` from the site `[outputs]` section, yielding:

    ```toml
    [outputs]
    home = [ "HTML", "RSS", "JSON" ]
    section = [ "HTML", "RSS" ]
    ```

## Pages

- fix authors no longer shown on publication page
- fix some tag and category links broken

## Thank you

Last but certainly not least, a big **_Thank You_** to [all the folks](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/graphs/contributors) that helped to make Academic even better.
