## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4.1 release of Academic. This version is all about **publications**! There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- [**Publication Search**](https://academic-demo.netlify.com/publication/)
  - In addition to the site search, a **search box has been added to the publication archive to enable filtering publications by any attribute**
  - This enables visitors to more **easily discover relevant content** by filtering author, publication, etc.
- [**Hero widget makeover**](https://academic-demo.netlify.com)
  - The Hero widget now supports multiple paragraphs and displaying an image (in addition to the optional background image)
  - [View the new hero options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/exampleSite/content/home/hero.md) used to create the Demo

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v4.0.0:

- Rename `abstract_short` in publications and talks to `summary` (if used)
- Rename `url_custom` to `links` in front matter of content (if used)

## Widgets

Hero widget makeover

- Support multiple paragraphs in the body of the widget
- Add optional image (`hero_media`) which appears on the right side of the widget
- Icon support for the `[cta]` call-to-action button using `icon` and `icon_pack`
- Add optional alternative call-to-action link, `[cta_alt]`
- Add optional note (`[cta_note]`) underneath the CTA button
- [View the new hero options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/master/exampleSite/content/home/hero.md) used to create the Demo

## Projects

- Fix the new v4.0.0 `post_view`, `publication_view`, `talk_view` options not working on project pages
