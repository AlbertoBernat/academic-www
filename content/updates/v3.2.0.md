## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the December 2018 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- **Redesign of search feature:** search from the navigation bar or with keyboard shortcuts:
  - Press `/` to toggle the search dialog and press `ESC` to close
- **New day and night modes:** enable users to switch between day (light) and night (dark) variations of your theme
- Fix projects not listing child pages when serving a site on Windows 

Also, the Academic **ecosystem has grown to include the following projects**:

* **[Academic Admin](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-admin):** An admin tool to import publications from BibTeX or import assets for an offline site
* **[Academic Scripts](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-scripts):** Scripts to help migrate content to new versions of Academic
* **[Project KickstartR](https://github.com/sourcethemes/project-kickstart-r):** Create a Project, Team, or Conference **Landing Page** and **Knowledge Sharing Platform** with (R) Markdown

## Breaking changes

Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v3.1.1:

- [View changes](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/compare/v3.1.1...v3.2.0#files_bucket) to `config.toml` - scroll down to the changes for the `exampleSite/config.toml` file
- Search widget is deprecated and `content/home/search.md` should be removed
- `url_project` can now only be used to link pages to external websites. To link a page to a project page, use `projects` option.
