Here are some considerations to make when updating Academic from the previous version, v4.1.0:

- Convert any widget pages by:
   - Removing `_index.md`
   - Adding `index.md` with the [new front matter](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/managing-content/#create-a-widget-page)
- Add `headless = true` to all widget page sections, i.e. all files in `content/home/` and to any widget page sections

## Widgets

  - New mobile first approach improves style of widgets on small devices
