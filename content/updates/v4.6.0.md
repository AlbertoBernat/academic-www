## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4.6 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- Based on your feedback, there's now an option to **disable linking authors to their profile page**
  - To disable author links, add `link_authors = false` to the _Advanced_ (or root) section of your `params.toml`
- **Improved robustness of search** to handle diacritics (accents) and Chinese/Korean/Japanese languages
- **Integrated [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com)**, allowing for very powerful analytics without needing to modify any code
- The [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) integration now uses the modern `gtag.js` approach
- A person's social links can now be shown in the [**People widget**]({{< relref "../docs/page-builder.md#people" >}})
  - See _Breaking Changes_ section below

## Breaking changes

### Params.toml

**If you wish to use Google Analytics or Google Tag Manager**, then add the following at the end of the file, including your associated tracking code:

```toml
############################
## Marketing
############################
[marketing]
  google_analytics = ""
  google_tag_manager = ""
```

Note that the old `googleAnalytics` option in `config.toml` is still supported, but may be deprecated in a future version.

Under the _Advanced_ (root) section, you can optionally add the option for **linking authors** (default is _true_):

```toml
# Link authors to their profile page? (true/false)
link_authors = true
```

### People widget

If you are using the _People_ widget, then you'll need to upgrade your settings. User Groups have moved under `[content]` and additional options have been added under `[design]`:

```toml
widget = "people"  # Use the People widget
headless = true  # This file represents a page section.

# ... Put Your Section Options Here (title etc.) ...

[content]
  # Choose which groups/teams of users to display.
  #   Edit `user_groups` in each user's profile to add them to one or more of these groups.
  user_groups = ["Principal Investigators",
                 "Researchers",
                 "Grad Students",
                 "Administration",
                 "Visitors",
                 "Alumni"]

[design]
  # Show user's social networking links? (true/false)
  show_social = false

  # Show user's interests? (true/false)
  show_interests = true
```

## Fixes

- fix: Hugo v0.58.0 breaks RSS template
- fix(publication): DOI link not shown if it's the only link
- fix: console error when clicking `back_to_top` button (did not affect _Back To Top_ functionality)
- fix: don't show address in Contact if it's an array of empty strings
  - An alternative is to comment out the `address` in Params if it's unused
