## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the v4.8 release of Academic. There are a number of exciting updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- **Admin interface to easily edit content online**
  - Support for writing blog posts and editing privacy policy and terms pages with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)
  - [Get started editing your content online](#netlify-cms)
- The **shape of avatars** can now be configured as a square or circle
- **New _icon_ shortcode** added to **render icons** within Markdown content
  - [See the documentation and demo of the new shortcode]({{< relref "writing-markdown-latex.md#icons" >}})
- Re-adds support for **opening external Markdown links in new tabs** using Hugo's new render hooks (the feature broke in Hugo v0.60 and was replaced with an alternative approach in Hugo v0.62)
- **Fixes external links opening both in current tab and in a new tab when using Google Analytics** (via `google_analytics` in `params.toml`)
- **Fixes lazy loading of images causing inaccurate anchor scrolling and active link highlighting**
  - As of a previous release, gallery and figure images are lazy loaded to speed up page load. However, lazy loading without initial image sizes defined can lead to inaccurate anchor scrolling and active link highlighting as the anchor offset changes after an uncached image occurring before the anchor is lazily loaded. This update helps resolve this. See [#1199 comment](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/issues/1199#issuecomment-577932174).
  
## Breaking changes

- **Hugo Extended v0.62+ required** - tested with [v0.63.1](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/0.63.1)
- If using Netlify, edit the Hugo version in `netlify.toml` to `0.63.1`

See the latest [parameters](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/exampleSite/config/_default/params.toml#L165) for help upgrading the following params:

- `shape` option added under new `[avatar]` section in `params.toml`
- `gravatar` option moved under new `[avatar]` section in `params.toml`

## Netlify CMS

We have added support for writing blog posts and editing privacy policy and terms pages with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), a free (open source) online content editor. We hope to expand support to other page types in the future.

To use,

- [Login to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), find the site you deployed with Netlify, and add yourself as an editor under the _Identity_ section
- Copy the [_admin_ folder](https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart/tree/master/static/admin) over to your `static/` folder and push your changes to your remote Git repository, such as Github
- Wait for your updated site to successfully deploy with Netlify, and head over to `YOUR_SITE.com/admin/` to view your content management panel

You can now easily edit blog posts online, for example:

{{< figure library="1" src="releases/v4.8-netlify-cms.png" title="Version 4.8 adds support for editing your content online in [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/)." >}}

Note that you **don't** need to *deploy* a site with *Netlify.com* in order to use *Netlify CMS*. However, in the default Netlify CMS provided, we assume the site is deployed with *Netlify.com* as we leverage its Identity feature to setup and authenticate people as content editors.

For multilingual sites, the content paths will need modifying appropriately in the Netlify CMS config file at `static/admin/config.yml`.

## Fixes

- Fix logo in navbar transforming into site title on mobile. See #1439. Fixes #1507.
- Add support for external_link in archives
  - Improves consistency: external projects are now opened in new tab whether they are viewed from the Portfolio widget or archive page. See #1525.
- Only allow auto day/night when day_night enabled. See #1526.

## Language Packs

- Add Latvian language (#1531)
- Add Khmer language (#1523)
- Update Basque (#1539)
- Update Korean (#1538)

## Misc

- style: upgrade Bootstrap from 4.3.1 to 4.4.1
