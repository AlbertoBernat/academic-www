## See what's new in Academic!

Welcome to the upcoming release of Academic. There are a number of updates in this version that we hope you will like, including:

- Add dark theme
- Enable your site to be installed to the home screen of a mobile device, providing users with quicker access and a richer experience
  - For example, if viewing this site in *Chrome for Android* on a mobile device, press the Chrome settings icon in the top right corner, press *Add to home screen* - a native-like app for the website will be installed to your home screen. A similar process can be followed for other mobile browsers such as *Firefox Mobile*.
- Enable modern web browsers to automatically load localized version of content in multilingual sites
- Add OpenStreetMap-based alternative to Google Maps (#360)
- Add option to hide/show talk time
- Display tags (if set) for all content types (not only for blog posts!)
- Improve social sharing by adding Twitter and Open Graph metadata to pages
- Re-enable RSS output by default (can be disabled in config)
